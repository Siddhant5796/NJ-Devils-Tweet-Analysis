# NJ Devils Tweet Analysis


The Datathonn was hosted by Harris Blitzer Sports and Entertainment (Owners of Philadelphia 76ers and NJ Devils).


In the current analysis, I analyzed NJ Devils tweets data to understand the trend in the number of tweets per day and factors affecting social media engagement using R, Python, and Tableau. I cleaned the data of 17000 tweets about NJ devils from 2018 to 2021 by removing emojis and imputing the missing values using Mice and Amelia packages to conduct sentimental analysis. I used a logistic regression analysis and successfully rejected the hypothesis that tweets containing emojis have less engagement rates compared to tweets without emojis, and suggested strategies to improve the media engagement.
